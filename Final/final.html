                <p>The New York Yankees are an internationally known franchise that was founded in Baltimore, Maryland in 1901 as the Baltimore Orioles and later moved to New York in 1903 as the New York Highlanders before finally becoming the New York Yankees in 1913. This notorious powerhouse of a franchise has 27 World Series championships and 40 American League pennants. Many legends have donned the pinstripes including Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio and of course Babe Ruth. The clubhouse is famous for making large financial investments to acquire larger then life talent. This fervor for recruiting the best of the best can be attributed to the efforts of the mercurial but never dull former-owner, "The Boss", George Michael Steinbrenner III. He is said to be the founder of free agency in the sports realm.</p>
                <p>The Yankees are arguably the most successful professional sports team in the United States; they have won 19 American League East Division titles, 40 American League pennants, and 27 World Series championships, all of which are MLB records. The team has won more titles than any other franchise in the four major North American sports leagues. Forty-four Yankees players and 11 Yankees managers have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Whitey Ford. In pursuit of winning championships, the franchise has used a large payroll to attract talent, particularly during the Steinbrenner era. According to Forbes, the Yankees are the second-highest valued sports franchise in the United States and the second in the world, with an estimated value of approximately $4.6 billion. The team has garnered enormous popularity and a dedicated fanbase, as well as widespread enmity from fans of other MLB teams. The team's rivalry with the Boston Red Sox is one of the most well-known rivalries in North American sports.</p>
