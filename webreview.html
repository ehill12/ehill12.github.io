        </header>
        <p>Being a senior in college, I have come to realize that finding a place to live after graduation is a struggle that people do tell you is hard, but not THIS hard. Part of the challenge in itself is finding a good place to find a good place. I've found some great websites to look that are easy to navigate and seem reliable, but there are also the sites that just look <i>sketchy</i>.</p>
        <p>Let's start with the good. The website that I enjoy the most to look for places to live is <a href="https://www.trulia.com">Trulia</a>. First, it is so easy to navigate and it guides you to find just what you are looking for. Front and center on the home page, you pick whether you want to see places to buy or rent and what area you are interested in. Once you hit the search button, it guides you to a list of listings that are displayed with a picture, price, and number of bedrooms and bathrooms. There is a lot of information on the website once you have submitted your criteria, but it is organized in a way that it isn't too overwhelming, it utilizes the power of whitespace extremely well to make sure their users aren't turned off by the information being too cluttered. The size of the images/text is also adaptable to the size of the page on your screen which is important on a website like this because you don't want to miss any information.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.zillow.com">Zillow</a> is very similar to Trulia. On the home page, there is a search bar to look in a specific area, but the options to buy or rent is in the corner, making it a little less apparent. When you decide which area and whether to buy or rent, though, it has a lot of the same features as Trulia. The use of whitespace is utilized extremely well, again, to keep users from being bombarded with information. The listings are also displayed with the same kind of information. One thing that separates its website from Trulia, though, is the use of color. The logo is a blue color and it is consistent throughout the whole website in the buttons, lines separating listings, and even the boundaries on the map of the area you select making the entire theme very clean and appealing.</p>
        <p>On the flip side, there's <a href="https://craigslist.org">Craigslist</a>. Looking at the home page itself, you are pegged with an unreal amount of text. Every single thing on the home page is a link to something else ... that's how much text there is. Looking at housing specifiaclly, though, you have all the same options as far as setting your location and some other specifics, but as I said above, when looking for housing you want to find options on a website that you trust, and on a website like Craigslist, it's hard to know. The way information is delivered to users does not always look reliable because anyone and everyone can post a listing on the website. There is a lot of whitespace too ... too much. There is no color scheme, no enticing pictures, and no element of security. One positive thing you could say about the website is that it is very straight and to the point.</p>
