                <li><b><a href="https://www.vermont.gov">Vermont</a></b></li>
                <p>Vermont's website is the most aesthetically pleasing. The photos they use help showcase all that Vermont has to offer, from nature to jobs to activites. The website is also extremely simple to use, there is a search bar right when the home page opens up, or you are able to easily navigate the tabs.</p>
                <li><b><a href="https://www.iowa.gov">Iowa</a></b></li>
                <p>The website for Iowa is another that is extremely easy to navigate. The tabs in their menu all make sense and give many options to get a visitor to where they want to be. The search bar is also front and center on this website. There are no problems with load times, and there are no inconsistencies.</p>
                <li><b><a href="https://www.tn.gov">Tennessee</a></b></li>
                <p>Tennessee's website is also very easy to navigate, all of their tabs are organized in a way that makes it as simple as possible for visitors. However, the website just doesn't <i>look</i> as good as the ones above. There is a lot of white space and the scrolling picture menu also does not look as sophisticated to me.</p>
                <li><b><a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a></b></li>
                <p>This website looks out of date. There is a lot of empty space, looks very generic, and there is just no aspect of "fun." The reason Alaska's website is not last, though, is because it still has a good navigation bar,and has options to help give a visitor exactly what they need.</p>
                <li><b><a href="https://www.ok.gov">Oklahoma</a></b></li>
                <p>The website for Oklahoma also looks very out dated. This website ranks last because it is hard to use. There is no navigation bar and the search bar is not necessarily front and center. The only way to get to another page is to click a link they have to articles in the upper fold, or one of the few links at the bottom of the page.</p>
