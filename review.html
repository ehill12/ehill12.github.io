    <h1>Emily's Web Hosting Review</h1>
    <p>Below are my opinions on the best features that each of these three website hosting companies, AWS being my top pick for "the best!"</p>
    
    <h2>Host #1: <a href="http://bluehost.com">Bluehost</a></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>One of the "top trusted website hosting providers"</li>
    <li>Continually focuses on innovation</li>
    <li>Transferring existing domain name is extremely easy</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Host #2: <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>"Has more services and more features within those services"</li>
    <li>Large number of customers are utilizing every service they offer with ease.</li>
    <li>Security is a priority</li>
    <li>Promotes fast-paced innovation for their customers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I picked AWS as the best because Amazon is already a brand I trust and AWS works with other well known brands that I interact with on a regular basis. I also find all of the features mentioned above extremely attractive.</p>
    
    <h2>Host #3: <a href="http://siteground.com">SiteGround</a></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Fast websites due to the servers they use</li>
    <li>Every plan they offer includes a WordPress installation to make websites with ease</li>
    <li>Unlimited number of email addresses available with domain name</li>
    </ul>
